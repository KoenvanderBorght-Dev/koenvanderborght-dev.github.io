Hi, I’m Koen van der Borght — a passionate software engineer and tech lead with over 8 years of experience. I started as an intern, worked my way up to senior developer, and currently lead the development team at [Gomocha](https://www.gomocha.com).

### What I do
- Lead Agile development teams as Scrum Master
- Architect solutions in .NET 8 and Microsoft Azure
- Automate CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps
- Optimize SQL Server performance and legacy systems
- Explore AI/ML opportunities in my workflow and in our products

### Fun facts
- Mechanical keyboard fan (Current daily driver is the Ergodox with Gateron Browns!)
- Movie nights with my wife Selina — we love Marvel & Harry Potter
- Proud dad of our daughter Niya

Let’s build better software, together.
